    :param feature_folder: The folder in which the feature extraction will be performed. This should be a folder
                           containing the .mat data files.
    :param extractor_function: A function to extract the segment data. Should accept a segment object as its first
                               argument.
    :param output_dir: The directory the features will be written to. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
    :param old_segment_format: Should the segment object be loaded with the old segment format.
    :param normalize_signal:
    :param workers: The numbers of processes to use for extracting features in parallel.
    :param naming_function: A function to use for generating the name of the feature file, should accept the two
                            positional arguments segment_path and output_dir, as well as the keyword arguments accepted
                            by the extractor function. If a naming function isn't supplied, a name will be generate
                            based on the name of the extractor function.
    :param sample_size: optionally sample this many samples from the input files.
    :param only_missing_files: If True, features will only be generated for files which are missing. Useful if you
                               started a feature extraction job but it failed before performing the extraction on all
                               files. To determine if the files are present, the naming function will be used.
    :param resample_frequency: If this is not None, the segments will be resampled to this frequency.
    :param extractor_kwargs: Keyword arguments for the extractor function
    :param file_handler: instance of gh to create files correctly.
    :return: None. The feature csv files are created by this function.
